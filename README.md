# Collaborative-Filtering-Million-Song-Dataset
Written in Python; collaborative filtering on a music dataset containing 48 million user - song - playcount triplets.

Although item - item similarities used too much memory to run on my laptop, user - user filtering alone achieved a mean average precision of .1106, 5.32 times as precise as recommending by song popularity alone.
